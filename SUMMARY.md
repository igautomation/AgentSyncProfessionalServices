```

### Distribution Strategy
We've implemented a distribution strategy that allows the framework to be shared across multiple projects:

1. **Package Distribution**: The framework is packaged as an npm package that can be installed in any project
2. **Version Management**: Semantic versioning ensures controlled updates
3. **Configuration Management**: Flexible configuration system allows project-specific customization
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation ensures consistent usage across projects

### Installation Options
The framework can be installed in several ways:

1. **From the local tarball**:
   ```bash
   npm install ./agentsync-test-framework-1.0.0.tgz
   ```

2. **Using the installation script**:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **From GitHub Packages** (after setup):
   ```bash
   npm install @agentsync/test-framework
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Set up GitHub Repository**: Create a GitHub repository for the framework
2. **Configure GitHub Packages**: Set up GitHub Packages for distribution
3. **Publish Initial Version**: Publish the initial version of the framework
4. **Migrate Existing Projects**: Migrate existing projects to use the framework
5. **Team Training**: Conduct training sessions for the team

## Conclusion

The AgentSync Test Framework is now ready for multi-project distribution. The framework provides a solid foundation for test automation across multiple projects, with a focus on maintainability, reusability, and scalability. The comprehensive documentation and distribution strategy ensure consistent usage across projects and teams.
