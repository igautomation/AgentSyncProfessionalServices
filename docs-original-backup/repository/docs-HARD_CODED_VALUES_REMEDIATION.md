# Hard-Coded Values Remediation Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the changes made to remove hard-coded URLs, credentials, and other sensitive data from the AgentSync Professional Services framework before publishing to client sites.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Hard-coded URLs

- **API Test Files**:
  - Removed hard-coded URL `https://reqres.in/api` from `user-api.spec.js`
  - Replaced with environment variables `API_BASE_URL` or `REQRES_API_URL`

- **Documentation Examples**:
  - Removed hard-coded URLs from `documentation-examples.md`
  - Replaced with environment variables like `EXAMPLE_URL`

- **Salesforce Configuration**:
  - Removed default login URL `https://login.salesforce.com` from `salesforce.config.js`
  - Removed default login URL from `salesforceApiUtils.js`

- **Environment Configuration**:
  - Removed hard-coded URLs for OrangeHRM demo site and ReqRes API from `dev.js`
  - Replaced with environment variables

### 2. Hard-coded Credentials

- **Environment Configuration**:
  - Removed hard-coded OrangeHRM demo credentials (`Admin`/`admin123`) from `dev.js`
  - Replaced with environment variables

- **Test Files**:
  - Removed hard-coded test user data (`John Doe`, `Software Engineer`) from `create-user.spec.js`
  - Replaced with environment variables or placeholders

- **Documentation Examples**:
  - Updated examples to use environment variables instead of hard-coded credentials

### 3. Hard-coded API Keys and Tokens

- **API Client**:
  - Removed hard-coded API keys and tokens
  - Improved API key handling to use environment variables

### 4. Environment Variables

- **Environment Template**:
  - Updated `.env.example` to remove all hard-coded values
  - Added new environment variables for user data and other configuration

- **Documentation**:
  - Created comprehensive guide on environment variables usage (`ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md`)
  - Updated README with environment variables section
  - Updated client setup checklist with detailed environment setup steps

## Recommendations for Future Maintenance

1. **Regular Code Reviews**:
   - Implement regular code reviews specifically looking for hard-coded values
   - Use automated tools to detect potential hard-coded credentials or URLs

2. **Environment Variables Management**:
   - Maintain a central registry of all required environment variables
   - Document each variable's purpose and expected format
   - Consider using a secrets management solution for production environments

3. **Documentation Standards**:
   - Establish clear guidelines for documentation examples
   - Use placeholders like `<your_api_key>` instead of example values
   - Include reminders about environment variables in documentation templates

4. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Add automated checks in CI/CD pipelines to detect hard-coded values
   - Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent committing sensitive data

5. **Developer Training**:
   - Train all developers on proper handling of sensitive data
   - Create a quick reference guide for environment variables usage

6. **Client Onboarding**:
   - Include environment setup in client onboarding process
   - Provide clear instructions for setting up environment variables

## Conclusion

The framework has been updated to remove hard-coded URLs, credentials, and other sensitive data. All such values now use environment variables or placeholders, making the framework suitable for deployment across multiple client projects. The documentation has been enhanced to provide clear guidance on environment variables usage.

Regular reviews and automated checks should be implemented to ensure no hard-coded values are introduced in future updates.
