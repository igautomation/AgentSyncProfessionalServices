# AgentSync Test Framework Delivery

## Implementation Summary

We've implemented a solution to convert the Playwright JS test automation framework into a private GitHub NPM package that can be securely used across multiple client projects.

### Key Components

1. **Framework as a Private GitHub Package**
   - Configured package.json with scoped name (`@agentsync/test-framework`)
   - Set up GitHub Packages registry in .npmrc
   - Added exports field for better module consumption

2. **GitHub Actions Integration**
   - Updated CI/CD workflow for automated testing and publishing
   - Created workflow templates for client projects

3. **Client Project Templates**
   - Created package.json template with framework dependency
   - Created playwright.config.js template that extends framework configuration
   - Created example test files demonstrating framework usage

4. **Setup and Documentation**
   - Created client project setup script
   - Created comprehensive guides for framework usage
   - Added troubleshooting information

## How It Works

1. **Framework Distribution**
   - The framework is published to GitHub Packages as `@agentsync/test-framework`
   - Access is controlled through GitHub authentication
   - Semantic versioning ensures compatibility

2. **Client Project Consumption**
   - Client projects install the framework as a dependency
   - Authentication is handled through GitHub tokens
   - Projects can pin to specific versions or use version ranges

3. **Updates and Maintenance**
   - Framework updates are published centrally
   - Client projects can update to new versions as needed
   - Breaking changes are managed through semantic versioning

## Benefits

- **Security**: Private access through GitHub authentication
- **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for framework code
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new client projects
- **Version Control**: Each project can use a specific framework version
- **Consistency**: Standardized approach across all projects

## Getting Started

### For Framework Maintainers

1. **Publish the Framework**

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
   npm run publish:framework
   ```

2. **Create a New Release**

   ```bash
   npm version patch  # or minor or major
   git push --follow-tags
   ```

   Or create a release through the GitHub UI.

### For Client Projects

1. **Set Up a New Project**

   ```bash
   npx @agentsync/test-framework setup:client-project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd client-project
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run Tests**

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Initial Release**
   - Publish the framework to GitHub Packages
   - Create the first release

2. **Client Onboarding**
   - Set up the first client project
   - Provide access to the GitHub repository

3. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Monitor usage and gather feedback
   - Plan for future enhancements
