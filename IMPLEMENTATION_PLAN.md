   - ✅ Added exports field for better module consumption
   - ✅ Configured publishConfig for GitHub Packages

2. **GitHub Packages Setup**
   - ✅ Created .npmrc file for GitHub Packages registry
   - ✅ Updated GitHub Actions workflow for automated publishing
   - ✅ Created publish script for manual publishing

3. **Client Project Templates**
   - ✅ Created package.json template for client projects
   - ✅ Created playwright.config.js template that extends framework config
   - ✅ Created .env template for environment variables
   - ✅ Created example test files demonstrating framework usage
   - ✅ Created GitHub Actions workflow template for client projects

4. **Setup and Automation**
   - ✅ Created client project setup script
   - ✅ Added setup:client-project npm script
   - ✅ Created directory structure for client project templates

5. **Documentation**
   - ✅ Created GitHub Packages setup guide
   - ✅ Created multi-project implementation guide
   - ✅ Created quick start guide
   - ✅ Created client setup checklist
   - ✅ Updated main README.md with GitHub Packages information
   - ✅ Created client setup guide

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (Week 1)

1. **Repository Configuration**
   - [ ] Create a dedicated GitHub repository for the framework
   - [ ] Configure repository settings for GitHub Packages
   - [ ] Set up branch protection rules

2. **Initial Publishing**
   - [ ] Publish the framework to GitHub Packages
   - [ ] Create the first release (v1.0.0)
   - [ ] Verify the package is accessible

3. **Documentation Deployment**
   - [ ] Deploy documentation to GitHub Pages
   - [ ] Create a documentation site with guides and examples

### Phase 2: Client Onboarding (Week 2)

1. **First Client Project**
   - [ ] Set up the first client project using the framework
   - [ ] Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - [ ] Create initial test cases

2. **Training and Support**
   - [ ] Conduct training session for client team
   - [ ] Provide documentation and examples
   - [ ] Set up support channels

3. **Validation**
   - [ ] Verify framework functionality in client project
   - [ ] Address any issues or feedback
   - [ ] Document lessons learned

### Phase 3: Scaling (Week 3-4)

1. **Additional Client Projects**
   - [ ] Set up additional client projects
   - [ ] Refine the setup process based on feedback
   - [ ] Create client-specific customizations if needed

2. **Framework Enhancements**
   - [ ] Implement feedback from client projects
   - [ ] Add new features and utilities
   - [ ] Release minor version updates

3. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - [ ] Set up monitoring for framework usage
   - [ ] Create a process for handling issues
   - [ ] Establish a regular update schedule

## Rollout Timeline

| Week | Tasks | Deliverables |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1    | Repository setup, initial publishing | Framework v1.0.0 published to GitHub Packages |
| 2    | First client project, training | Client project setup, documentation |
| 3    | Additional client projects, refinements | Multiple client projects using the framework |
| 4    | Framework enhancements, monitoring | Framework v1.1.0 with improvements |

## Success Criteria

- Framework is successfully published to GitHub Packages
- Multiple client projects are using the framework
- Tests are running successfully in GitHub Actions
- Client teams are able to create and maintain tests
- Framework updates can be distributed to all projects

## Risk Management

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| GitHub authentication issues | Provide detailed setup guide, offer direct support |
| Breaking changes in framework updates | Follow semantic versioning, provide migration guides |
| Client-specific requirements | Create extension points in the framework, allow customization |
| Performance issues in CI/CD | Optimize test execution, implement parallel testing |
| Security concerns with token management | Document token rotation process, use least privilege |

## Next Steps

1. Create a dedicated GitHub repository for the framework
2. Publish the initial version to GitHub Packages
3. Set up the first client project
4. Gather feedback and iterate
