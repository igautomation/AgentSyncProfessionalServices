// Or import specific utilities
const { 
  logger, 
  PlaywrightService, 
  PlaywrightUtils, 
  dataUtils 
} = require('../src/utils/common');

// Use logger
logger.info('This is an info message');
logger.error('This is an error message');

// Use Playwright service
const service = new PlaywrightService();
await service.captureScreenshot('https://example.com');

// Use data utilities
const data = await dataUtils.readJsonData('path/to/data.json');

// Use test data factory
const user = TestDataFactory.createUser();
const products = TestDataFactory.createProducts(5);

// Use retry with backoff
const retry = new RetryWithBackoff();
const result = await retry.execute(async () => {
