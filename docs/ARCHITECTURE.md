# Test Framework Architecture

## Overview
This framework provides a comprehensive solution for automated testing of web applications, APIs, and accessibility compliance. It's built on Playwright and follows a modular design pattern.

## Key Components

### 1. Test Organization
- **Core Tests**: Basic functionality tests using reliable test sites
- **API Tests**: REST API testing with schema validation
- **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance testing
- **Salesforce Tests**: Specialized tests for Salesforce applications

### 2. Framework Structure
- **tests/**: Test files organized by category
- **utils/**: Shared utilities and helpers
- **config/**: Environment-specific configuration
- **auth/**: Authentication state storage
- **reports/**: Test execution reports

### 3. Authentication Flow
- Global setup authenticates with external services
- Authentication states are stored for reuse
- Session expiration is handled with consistent timeouts
- Retry mechanisms handle transient failures

### 4. Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures
- Detailed error logging with sensitive data protection
- Test skipping when dependencies are unavailable
- Exponential backoff for retries

### 5. Best Practices
- Reliable tests use stable test sites
- Unreliable tests are skipped by default
- Modular utilities promote code reuse
- Clear separation of concerns

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Test Data Management**
   - Implement isolated test data for parallel runs
   - Add data cleanup after test execution

2. **Security Enhancements**
   - Implement credential rotation
   - Add comprehensive sensitive data masking

3. **Reporting**
   - Integrate with external reporting systems
   - Add trend analysis for test results

4. **Performance**
   - Optimize test parallelization
   - Implement selective test execution
