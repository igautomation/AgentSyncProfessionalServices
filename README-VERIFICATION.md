# Test Framework Verification

This document provides instructions on how to verify that the test framework is working correctly.

## Quick Start

To verify that the test framework is working correctly, run:

```bash
npm run verify:framework
```

This will run a simple verification test that confirms the test framework is working correctly.

## What the Verification Test Does

The verification test:

1. Runs a simple test that verifies the test framework is working
2. Performs basic assertions to confirm that the test framework is functioning correctly
3. Reports the results of the test

## Expected Output

If the test framework is working correctly, you should see output similar to:

```
Running verification test to confirm the test framework is working...

Running 2 tests using 1 worker
  2 passed (Xms)

Verification test completed successfully!
The test framework is working correctly.
```

## Troubleshooting

If the verification test fails, try the following:

1. Make sure all dependencies are installed:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Make sure Playwright browsers are installed:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

3. Check for any error messages in the console output.

4. Try running the verification test directly:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test src/tests/verification-test.spec.js
   ```

5. If you're still having issues, please refer to the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) for more information.
