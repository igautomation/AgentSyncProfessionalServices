# Salesforce Test Improvements

## Overview

This document explains the improvements made to the Salesforce tests to address reliability issues.

## New Files Created

1. **Fixed Login Test**: `src/tests/salesforce/fixed-sf-login.spec.js`
   - Improved login process with better error handling and logging
   - Increased timeouts for better reliability

2. **Minimal Navigation Test**: `src/tests/salesforce/minimal-navigation.spec.js`
   - Diagnostic test to identify navigation issues
   - Tests multiple methods of accessing the App Launcher
   - Implements direct URL navigation as a fallback

3. **Fixed Account-Contact Test**: `src/tests/salesforce/fixed-account-contact.spec.js`
   - Uses direct URL navigation instead of UI navigation
   - Implements better error handling and logging
   - Uses more specific selectors for form fields

4. **Test Runner Script**: `run-fixed-tests.sh`
   - Runs the fixed tests in sequence
   - Ensures proper test dependencies

5. **Documentation**: `salesforce-test-improvements.md`
   - Detailed analysis of issues and solutions
   - Recommendations for future test development

## New NPM Scripts

Added the following scripts to `package.json`:

- `test:sf:fixed`: Runs all fixed Salesforce tests using the shell script
- `test:sf:fixed:login`: Runs only the fixed login test
- `test:sf:fixed:account`: Runs only the fixed account-contact test

## Key Improvements

1. **Direct URL Navigation**
   - Bypasses unreliable UI navigation
   - Reduces test flakiness

2. **Improved Selectors**
   - More specific selectors for ambiguous elements
   - Better handling of dynamic content

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Try/catch blocks around critical operations
   - Better logging and screenshots for debugging

4. **Increased Timeouts**
   - Longer timeouts for Salesforce operations
   - Better handling of network delays

5. **Improved Test Independence**
   - Reduced dependencies between tests
   - Better handling of test prerequisites

## Usage

To run the fixed tests:

```bash
npm run test:sf:fixed
```

Or run individual tests:

```bash
npm run test:sf:fixed:login
npm run test:sf:fixed:account
```

## Next Steps

1. Apply these patterns to all Salesforce tests
2. Implement a Salesforce-specific Page Object Model
3. Set up more robust authentication mechanisms
4. Consider using API calls for test data setup
