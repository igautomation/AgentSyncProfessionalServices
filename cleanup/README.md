# Cleanup Directory

This directory contains files that have been moved from the project root during cleanup:

- **q-dev-chat-*.md**: Chat logs from development sessions
- **.history/**: File history from IDE
- **USER_GUIDE.md, FRAMEWORK_GUIDE.md**: Duplicate documentation files (now consolidated in docs/)

These files are kept for reference but are not part of the active project structure.
