# Playwright Integration Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating how to use the PlaywrightService for various tasks in the Playwright Framework.

## Overview

The PlaywrightService provides a unified interface for browser automation tasks, including:

- Screenshot capture
- PDF generation
- Accessibility testing
- Responsive design testing
- Network mocking
- Debugging with traces

## Examples

### Screenshot Capture (`screenshot-example.js`)

Demonstrates how to:
- Capture full page screenshots
- Capture screenshots of specific elements
- Capture screenshots with different viewport sizes

```bash
node screenshot-example.js
```

### PDF Generation (`pdf-example.js`)

Demonstrates how to:
- Generate basic PDFs from web pages
- Customize PDF formatting (headers, footers, margins)
- Generate PDFs in landscape mode

```bash
node pdf-example.js
```

### Accessibility Testing (`accessibility-example.js`)

Demonstrates how to:
- Run accessibility audits on web pages
- Identify common accessibility issues
- Generate accessibility reports

```bash
node accessibility-example.js
```

### Responsive Design Testing (`responsive-example.js`)

Demonstrates how to:
- Test web pages across different device viewports
- Identify responsive design issues
- Generate screenshots for different devices

```bash
node responsive-example.js
```

### Trace Capture for Debugging (`trace-example.js`)

Demonstrates how to:
- Capture detailed traces of browser interactions
- Handle errors during trace capture
- Use custom error handling with traces

```bash
node trace-example.js
```

### Network Mocking (`network-mock-example.js`)

Demonstrates how to:
- Mock API responses for testing
- Simulate error conditions
- Test loading states with delayed responses

```bash
node network-mock-example.js
```

## Running the Examples

1. Make sure you have installed the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Run any example using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node examples/playwright/<example-file>.js
   ```

3. Check the output in the `examples/playwright/output` directory.

## Viewing Traces

To view a trace file generated by the examples:

```bash
npx playwright show-trace examples/playwright/output/<trace-file>.zip
```

This will open the Playwright Trace Viewer in your browser, where you can:
- Step through each action
- View screenshots at each step
- Inspect the DOM at each step
- View network requests
- View console logs
