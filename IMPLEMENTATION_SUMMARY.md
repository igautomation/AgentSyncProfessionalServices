# Framework Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of converting the AgentSync Playwright test automation framework into a private GitHub NPM package for secure multi-project distribution.

## Key Components

1. **Framework as a Private GitHub Package**
   - Configured package.json with scoped name (@igautomation/test-framework)
   - Set up GitHub Packages registry in .npmrc
   - Updated GitHub Actions workflow for automated publishing

2. **Client Project Templates**
   - Created package.json template with framework dependency
   - Created playwright.config.js template that extends framework configuration
   - Created example test files demonstrating framework usage

3. **Setup Automation**
   - Created client project setup script
   - Added setup:client-project npm script

## How It Works

### Publishing the Framework

1. Create a GitHub release to trigger automatic publishing:
   - Go to GitHub repository
   - Create a new release with semantic version (e.g., v1.0.0)
   - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically publish to GitHub Packages

2. Manual publishing:
   ```bash
   export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_personal_access_token
   npm run publish:framework
   ```

### Setting Up Client Projects

1. Using the setup script:
   ```bash
   npx @igautomation/test-framework setup:client-project
   ```

2. Manual setup:
   - Create .npmrc file with GitHub authentication
   - Create package.json with framework dependency
   - Create playwright.config.js extending framework configuration

## Next Steps

1. Push code to GitHub repository
2. Create initial release (v1.0.0)
3. Set up first client project
4. Document any issues or feedback
