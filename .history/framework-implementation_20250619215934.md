Need best practise advise. Client is using GitHub and GitHub actions  - I have built this framework for a client. Now the client has multiple projects within their ecosystem. What should be my framework usage policy in terms of multiple projects for examples multiple branches, multiple folders, or anything best.

---



Based on your test automation framework and the client's multi-project ecosystem, here are the best practices for framework usage policy:

## Framework Distribution Strategy

**Recommended Approach: NPM Package + Monorepo Structure**

### 1. **Framework as NPM Package**
- Publish your framework as a private NPM package
- Version it semantically (e.g., v1.2.3)
- Each project installs the framework as a dependency
- Enables controlled updates and version management

### 2. **Repository Structure Options**

**Option A: Separate Framework Repository (Recommended)**
```
framework-repo/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ core/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â””â”€â”€ CHANGELOG.md

project-1-repo/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json (framework as dependency)
â””â”€â”€ project-specific configs

project-2-repo/
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json (framework as dependency)
â””â”€â”€ project-specific configs
```

**Option B: Monorepo Structure**
```
client-testing-ecosystem/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test-framework/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project-1-tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project-2-tests/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ shared-configs/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ lerna.json or nx.json
```

### 3. **Branching Strategy**

**Framework Repository:**
- `main` - Stable releases
- `develop` - Integration branch
- `feature/*` - New features
- `hotfix/*` - Critical fixes
- `release/*` - Release preparation

**Project Repositories:**
- `main` - Production tests
- `develop` - Test development
- `feature/*` - New test features

### 4. **Version Management Policy**

```json
// Framework package.json
{
  "name": "@client/test-framework",
  "version": "1.2.3",
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@playwright/test": "^1.40.0"
  }
}
```

**Versioning Rules:**
- **Major (X.0.0)**: Breaking changes
- **Minor (1.X.0)**: New features, backward compatible
- **Patch (1.2.X)**: Bug fixes

### 5. **GitHub Actions Integration**

**Framework CI/CD:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/framework-ci.yml
name: Framework CI/CD
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test-and-publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          registry-url: 'https://npm.pkg.github.com'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
      
      - name: Publish to NPM
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**Project CI/CD:**
```yaml
# Each project's workflow
name: Project Tests
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:e2e
```

### 6. **Configuration Management**

**Framework-level config:**
```javascript
// framework/src/config/base.config.js
export const baseConfig = {
  timeout: 30000,
  retries: 2,
  selfHealing: {
    enabled: true,
    logLevel: 'info'
  }
};
```

**Project-level config:**
```javascript
// project/playwright.config.js
import { baseConfig } from '@client/test-framework/config';

export default {
  ...baseConfig,
  testDir: './tests',
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'project-specific-setup',
      use: { ...baseConfig.use, baseURL: 'https://project1.client.com' }
    }
  ]
};
```

### 7. **Documentation Strategy**

- **Framework README**: Installation, API reference, examples
- **Project READMEs**: Project-specific test setup and execution
- **CHANGELOG**: Track framework updates
- **Migration guides**: For major version updates

### 8. **Dependency Management**

```json
// Project package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@client/test-framework": "^1.2.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@playwright/test": "^1.40.0"
  }
}
```

### 9. **Quality Gates**

- Framework changes require approval from 2+ reviewers
- All projects must pass tests before framework updates
- Automated security scanning for dependencies
- Performance regression testing

### 10. **Communication Strategy**

- **Slack/Teams notifications** for framework updates
- **Release notes** for each version
- **Migration workshops** for major updates
- **Office hours** for framework support

This approach ensures maintainability, scalability, and controlled distribution across your client's multiple projects while leveraging GitHub's ecosystem effectively.

- **Easy Project Setup**: One command to initialize new projects
- **Version Management**: Semantic versioning with automated releases
- **Consistent Configuration**: Standardized setup across all projects
- **Self-Healing Locators**: Built-in resilience for UI changes

### ðŸ“‹ **Next Steps**

1. **Week 1**: Set up GitHub repository and publish initial framework version
2. **Week 2**: Migrate existing projects and set up new ones
3. **Week 3**: Team training and onboarding
4. **Week 4**: Monitor adoption and optimize

### ðŸ”§ **Quick Commands**

```bash

npm run release

# Update framework in existing project
npm update @agentsync/test-framework
```

The framework is now ready for multi-project distribution with proper version control, automated CI/CD, and comprehensive documentation. This approach will scale efficiently across your client's multiple projects while maintaining consistency and reducing maintenance overhead.
