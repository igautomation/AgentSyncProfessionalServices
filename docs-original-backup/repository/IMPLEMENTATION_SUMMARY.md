# Implementation Summary: Project Templates

## Overview

We've successfully implemented project templates as part of the framework package. This allows teams to quickly set up new test projects with the correct structure and configuration.

## Key Components

1. **Template Structure**
   - Basic template for general web testing
   - Salesforce template for Salesforce-specific testing
   - Each template includes example tests, configuration files, and documentation

2. **Initialization Script**
   - Added `bin/init-project.js` script for creating new projects from templates
   - Command-line options for selecting templates and target directories
   - Automatic setup of necessary directories and files

3. **Package Updates**
   - Updated package.json to include templates in the published package
   - Added new binary command for project initialization
   - Added documentation for using templates

## Usage

Teams can now create new projects using:

```bash
# Using npx
npx @igautomation/agentsyncprofessionalservices init -t basic -d my-project

# Or if installed globally
agentsync-init -t basic -d my-project
```

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All projects will have the same structure and configuration
2. **Efficiency**: Teams can start writing tests immediately without setup overhead
3. **Best Practices**: Templates enforce framework best practices
4. **Learning**: Example tests help new users understand how to use the framework

## Next Steps

1. **Publish Updated Package**: Publish the new version with templates included
2. **Documentation**: Share the templates guide with teams
3. **Feedback**: Gather feedback on templates and improve them in future versions
4. **Additional Templates**: Consider adding more specialized templates based on team needs
