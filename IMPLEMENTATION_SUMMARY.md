# Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of converting the AgentSync Playwright test automation framework into a private GitHub NPM package.

## Key Changes

1. **Package Configuration**
   - Updated package name to `@igautomation/agentsyncprofessionalservices` to match GitHub repository
   - Configured for GitHub Packages registry
   - Added exports field for better module consumption

2. **GitHub Integration**
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing and publishing
   - Added explicit permissions for package publishing
   - Created publish script for manual publishing

3. **Client Project Templates**
   - Created templates for client projects
   - Added setup script for easy project initialization
   - Updated all references to use the correct package name

## Next Steps

1. **Create GitHub Release**
   - Go to https://github.com/igautomation/AgentSyncProfessionalServices/releases
   - Create a new release with tag `v1.0.0`
   - This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to publish the package

2. **Set Up Client Project**
   - Use the setup script: `npx @igautomation/agentsyncprofessionalservices setup:client-project`
   - Or follow the manual setup guide in docs/CLIENT_SETUP.md

3. **Verify Installation**
   - Create a simple test using the framework
   - Run the test to verify everything works correctly

## Important Notes

- The package name must match the GitHub repository name exactly
- GitHub token must have `write:packages` permission
- Client projects need `read:packages` permission
