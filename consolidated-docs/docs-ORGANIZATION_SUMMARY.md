# Project Organization Summary

## Changes Made

The project has been reorganized to improve maintainability and navigation:

### 1. Documentation Consolidation

Documentation has been moved from the root directory to a structured documentation directory:

```
/docs/
  /guides/           # User guides
    INSTALLATION.md
    RUNNING_TESTS.md
    DOCKER.md
    FEATURES.md
  /reference/        # Reference documentation
    ENV_VARIABLES.md
  /maintenance/      # Maintenance documentation
    CONTRIBUTING.md
    MAINTENANCE.md
  /reports/          # Project reports
    CONSOLIDATION_REPORT.md
    VALIDATION_REPORT.md
  ORGANIZATION.md    # Organization guide
```

### 2. README Consolidation

All README files have been consolidated into a single comprehensive README.md with links to detailed documentation.

### 3. Root Directory Cleanup

The root directory has been cleaned up by:
- Moving documentation files to the appropriate directories
- Removing redundant files
- Keeping only essential configuration files in the root

### 4. Cleanup Script

A cleanup script has been created to automate the process:
- `scripts/cleanup-root.js`: Moves and removes files from the root directory

## Benefits

1. **Improved Navigation**: Documentation is now organized by purpose
2. **Reduced Clutter**: Root directory contains only essential files
3. **Better Maintainability**: Documentation is easier to find and update
4. **Consolidated Information**: Related information is grouped together

## Next Steps

1. **Update Links**: Ensure all internal links in documentation are updated
2. **Review Documentation**: Review all documentation for accuracy and completeness
3. **Add to CI**: Consider adding documentation validation to CI pipeline
4. **Automate Documentation**: Consider automating documentation generation

## Files Kept in Root

Essential configuration files kept in the root:
- `.env.example`: Example environment variables
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore file
- `package.json`: Package configuration
- `playwright.config.js`: Playwright configuration
- `README.md`: Main README file
- `LICENSE.md`: License file

## Conclusion

The project is now better organized with a clear structure for documentation and configuration files. This will make it easier to navigate and maintain the project in the future.
