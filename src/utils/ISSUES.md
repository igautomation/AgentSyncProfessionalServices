# Utils Directory Issues

This document outlines the issues found in the utils directory and provides recommendations for fixing them.

## Duplicate Files

The following files are duplicated in multiple locations:

### 1. accessibilityUtils.js

Found in:
- `/src/utils/accessibility/accessibilityUtils.js`
- `/src/utils/web/accessibilityUtils.js`

**Recommendation**: Consolidate into a single file in the `accessibility` directory and update all imports to reference this file.

### 2. performanceUtils.js

Found in:
- `/src/utils/performance/performanceUtils.js`
- `/src/utils/web/performanceUtils.js`

**Recommendation**: Consolidate into a single file in the `performance` directory and update all imports to reference this file.

### 3. index.js

Found in multiple directories:
- `/src/utils/common/index.js`
- `/src/utils/index.js`
- `/src/utils/scheduler/index.js`
- `/src/utils/visualization/index.js`
- `/src/utils/web/index.js`

**Recommendation**: This is not necessarily an issue as index files are commonly used to export functionality from each directory. However, ensure that each index file has a clear purpose and doesn't duplicate functionality.

## Organization Issues

1. **Scattered Functionality**: Some functionality is spread across multiple directories (e.g., accessibility, performance).

2. **Inconsistent Naming**: Some files use camelCase (e.g., `apiUtils.js`), while others use PascalCase (e.g., `SelfHealingLocator.js`).

3. **Redundant Utilities**: There may be overlapping functionality between different utility files.

## Action Plan

1. **Consolidate Duplicate Files**:
   - Move web-specific accessibility functions to the main accessibility utils
   - Move web-specific performance functions to the main performance utils

2. **Standardize Naming**:
   - Use consistent naming conventions for all utility files
   - Recommend using camelCase for utility files and PascalCase for classes

3. **Improve Documentation**:
   - Ensure all utility files have proper JSDoc comments
   - Add examples of how to use each utility

4. **Refactor Overlapping Functionality**:
   - Identify and consolidate overlapping functionality
   - Create clear boundaries between different utility categories
