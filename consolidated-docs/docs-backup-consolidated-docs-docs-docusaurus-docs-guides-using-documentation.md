# Using the Documentation

This guide provides practical tips on how to effectively use the Playwright Framework documentation to find information and solve problems.

## Documentation Access Methods

### Online Documentation

The primary way to access the documentation is through the online documentation site:

```
https://your-org.github.io/playwright-framework/
```

This site is always up-to-date with the latest version of the framework.

### Local Documentation

You can also access the documentation locally, which is useful when working offline:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/playwright-framework.git
   ```

2. Build the documentation:
   ```bash
   cd playwright-framework
   ./build-docs.sh
   ```

3. Serve the documentation locally:
   ```bash
   cd docs/docusaurus
   npm run serve
   ```

4. Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### PDF Documentation

For offline reference, you can download the complete documentation as a PDF:

1. Navigate to the online documentation
2. Click on "PDF Guide" in the top navigation bar
3. Save the PDF to your computer

## Finding Information

### Using the Search Function

The search function is the fastest way to find specific information:

1. Click on the search icon in the top navigation bar (or press `/` on your keyboard)
2. Type your search query
3. Browse the search results
4. Click on a result to navigate to that page

The search function indexes all content, including:
- Page titles
- Headings
- Text content
- Code examples

### Using the Sidebar Navigation

The sidebar provides a hierarchical view of the documentation:

1. Expand sections by clicking on the section headers
2. Navigate to pages by clicking on the page links
3. Collapse sections by clicking on the section headers again

The sidebar is organized into main sections:
- **Getting Started**: Basic information to get up and running
- **Guides**: Detailed guides for specific features
- **API Reference**: Technical reference for the framework's APIs
- **Advanced Topics**: In-depth information on advanced features
- **Examples**: Code examples for common scenarios

### Using Breadcrumbs

Breadcrumbs at the top of each page show your current location in the documentation:

```
Documentation > Guides > Test Verification
```

Click on any part of the breadcrumb to navigate to that section.
