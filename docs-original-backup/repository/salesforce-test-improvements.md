# Salesforce Test Improvements

## Issues Identified

After analyzing the failing Salesforce tests, we identified several key issues:

1. **Navigation Timeouts**: The App Launcher button was not consistently found within the default timeout period.
2. **Network Stability**: Tests were failing with "Network did not reach idle state" errors.
3. **Element Selection**: Some selectors were not specific enough, causing ambiguity.
4. **Test Dependencies**: Tests were dependent on previous tests completing successfully.
5. **Error Handling**: Insufficient error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Improved Login Process

- Increased timeouts for authentication
- Added better error handling and logging
- Ensured proper storage of authentication state

### 2. Direct Navigation

- Bypassed the App Launcher UI by using direct URL navigation
- Used specific URLs for different Salesforce objects (accounts, contacts)
- Reduced dependency on UI elements that might be slow to load

### 3. Better Selectors

- Used more specific selectors for ambiguous elements
- Added fallback mechanisms when elements can't be found
- Used CSS selectors instead of role-based selectors when needed

### 4. Improved Error Handling

- Added try/catch blocks around critical operations
- Implemented better logging for debugging
- Added screenshots at key points for visual verification

### 5. Test Independence

- Reduced dependencies between tests
- Used file-based state sharing when needed
- Added checks to handle missing prerequisites

## Recommendations for Future Tests

1. **Use Direct Navigation**: Whenever possible, navigate directly to Salesforce URLs instead of using the UI navigation.

2. **Increase Timeouts**: Set longer timeouts for Salesforce operations:
   ```javascript
   page.setDefaultTimeout(120000);
   ```

3. **Implement Robust Waiting**: Use a combination of waiting strategies:
   ```javascript
   async function waitForPageLoad(page) {
     await page.waitForLoadState('domcontentloaded');
     const spinner = page.locator('.slds-spinner');
     if (await spinner.isVisible().catch(() => false)) {
       await spinner.waitFor({ state: 'hidden', timeout: 30000 }).catch(() => {});
     }
     await page.waitForTimeout(2000);
   }
   ```

4. **Use Specific Selectors**: For fields with potential ambiguity, use name or ID-based selectors:
   ```javascript
   // Instead of:
   await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: 'Phone' }).fill('555-123-4567');
   
   // Use:
   await page.locator('input[name="Phone"]').fill('555-123-4567');
   ```

5. **Add Comprehensive Error Handling**:
   ```javascript
   try {
     // Test operations
   } catch (error) {
     console.error(`Operation failed: ${error.message}`);
     await page.screenshot({ path: './error-screenshot.png' });
     throw error;
   }
   ```

6. **Run Tests in Headful Mode During Development**: Use the `--headed` flag to visually observe test execution.

## Next Steps

1. Apply these patterns to all Salesforce tests
2. Consider implementing a Salesforce-specific Page Object Model
3. Set up a more robust authentication mechanism
4. Implement better test data management
5. Consider using API calls for test data setup instead of UI interactions
