- `docs-backup/` - Backup documentation
- `temp/` - Temporary files
- `sandbox/` - Development sandbox
- `logs/` - Test execution logs
- `playwright-report/` - Generated reports
- `test-results/` - Test results

- Temporary and log files

### Kept for Client:
- `.env.example` - Template for environment variables
- All source code and framework functionality

- API testing capabilities
- Accessibility testing
- Salesforce integration
- Performance testing
- Visual regression testing
- CI/CD integration
- Comprehensive reporting

## ðŸ“š Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `docs/` directory:

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Cannot find module 'dotenv'" error**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **GitHub Actions failing**
   - Ensure all dependencies are in package.json
   - Check that workflow files reference correct directories
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly

3. **Missing Playwright browsers**
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

4. **Tests not finding elements**
   - Check if `.env` file exists and has correct URLs
   - Verify network connectivity to test sites

### Verification Test:
```bash
# Run a simple test to verify setup
npx playwright test --list | head -5
```

## ðŸ†˜ Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check the documentation in the `docs/` directory
2. Review the example tests in `src/tests/examples/`
3. Check the configuration files in `src/config/`
4. Run the verification test above

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files with real credentials
- Use `.env.example` as a template
- Store sensitive credentials securely
- Review the `.gitignore` file to ensure sensitive files are excluded
